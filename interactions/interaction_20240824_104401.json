      "summary_text": "The patient underwent surgery on May 2, 2023, to remove a mass, but mishandling of sterile equipment led to a post-operative infection, delaying recovery and worsening the patient's health. On May 15, the patient developed sepsis and required ICU admission due to the systemic response from the infection. Treatment with IV antibiotics stabilized the patient, but delays in diagnosis and treatment had significant negative effects on their health and quality of life. Key breaches of duty included failure to conduct necessary diagnostic tests, delays in scheduling imaging, inadequate post-surgical care, and communication failures between departments. These issues contributed to the patient's deteriorating condition, highlighting that early detection and proper surgical practices could have prevented the infection and its serious consequences."
