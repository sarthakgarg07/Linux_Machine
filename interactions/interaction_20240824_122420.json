      "summary_text": "The patient underwent surgery on May 2, 2023, to remove a mass, but mishandling of sterile equipment during the procedure led to a post-operative infection, causing delayed recovery and negatively affecting the patient's health. On May 15, 2023, the patient developed sepsis and was admitted to the ICU, requiring IV antibiotics for stabilization. The case highlights multiple breaches of duty, including failure to conduct necessary diagnostic tests, delays in imaging, inadequate post-surgical care, and communication failures among departments, all contributing to the patient's deteriorating condition. The report concludes that early detection and proper surgical practices could have minimized harm, recommending a review of hospital procedures to prevent future incidents.
