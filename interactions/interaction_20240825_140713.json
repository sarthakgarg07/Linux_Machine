Event 6: Development of Sepsis and ICU Admission (May 15, 2023)  \nOn May 15, 2023, the patient developed sepsis and was admitted to the ICU. The infection, \nwhich originated from improper sterilization during surgery, caused a systemic response, \nleading to the need for critical care. The patient was treated with IV antibi otics and eventually \nstabilized, but the delay in diagnosis and treatment significantly impacted his overall health \nand quality of life. 4.
