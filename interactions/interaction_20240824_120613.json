      "original_text": "Despite the worsening of his abdominal pain, Dr. Harper referred the patient for an \nultrasound, scheduled nearly three weeks later. This delay, coupled with the absence of \nimmediate imaging or blood work, contributed to the worsening of the condition. Event 3: Ultrasound Delays (March 15, 2023)  \nThe ultrasound appointment, scheduled for March 15, 2023, was postponed due to hospital \nscheduling issues. The patient was not informed of the delay until he reached out on April 1, \n2023, when a new ultrasound appointment was scheduled. This postponement c ontributed to \na delay in the diagnosis of the abdominal mass. Event 4: Diagnosis and Referral to Gastroenterology (April 5, 2023)  \nAn ultrasound finally conducted on April 5, 2023, revealed a large abdominal mass. Despite \nthe urgency, a referral to a gastroenterologist was not made until April 25, 2023, after \nmultiple administrative communication errors within the hospital. By this time, the patient\u2019s \ncond ition had deteriorated further, causing severe pain and other complications. Event 5: Surgery and Post -Surgical Infection (May 2, 2023)"
