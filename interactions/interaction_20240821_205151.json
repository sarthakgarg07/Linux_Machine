Detailed Description of Events  \nEvent 1: Initial Consultation (February 5, 2023)  \nThe patient first presented to Dr.  Emily Harper with complaints of severe and persistent \nabdominal pain. Dr. Harper, without performing any diagnostic tests, diagnosed the patient \nwith gastritis and prescribed a course of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). No further \ninvestigations, such as bl ood tests or imaging, were recommended. This was the first opportunity to identify the underlying issue, which later proved to be a \nlarge abdominal mass.

During the procedure, it \nwas noted that the sterile equipment used was mishandled, leading to post -operative \ninfection. This infection caused a delayed recovery and significantly impacted the  patient\u2019s \nhealth. Improper use of antibiotics and delays in responding to the infection also contributed \nto the deterioration of the patient\u2019s condition. Event 6: Development of Sepsis and ICU Admission (May 15, 2023)  \nOn May 15, 2023, the patient developed sepsis and was admitted to the ICU. The infection, \nwhich originated from improper sterilization during surgery, caused a systemic response, \nleading to the need for critical care. The patient was treated with IV antibi otics and eventually \nstabilized, but the delay in diagnosis and treatment significantly impacted his overall health \nand quality of life. 4. Breach of Duty  \nMultiple breaches of duty occurred in this case:  \n\u2022 Failure to Properly Investigate:  During the initial consultation, Dr. Harper failed to \nperform necessary diagnostic tests, missing the opportunity for early detection. \u2022 Delay in Imaging:  The scheduling and execution of the abdominal ultrasound were \ndelayed due to administrative and communication errors, further postponing the \ndiagnosis.",

This delay, coupled with the absence of \nimmediate imaging or blood work, contributed to the worsening of the condition. Event 3: Ultrasound Delays (March 15, 2023)  \nThe ultrasound appointment, scheduled for March 15, 2023, was postponed due to hospital \nscheduling issues. The patient was not informed of the delay until he reached out on April 1, \n2023, when a new ultrasound appointment was scheduled. This postponement c ontributed to \na delay in the diagnosis of the abdominal mass. Event 4: Diagnosis and Referral to Gastroenterology (April 5, 2023)  \nAn ultrasound finally conducted on April 5, 2023, revealed a large abdominal mass. Despite \nthe urgency, a referral to a gastroenterologist was not made until April 25, 2023, after \nmultiple administrative communication errors within the hospital. By this time, the patient\u2019s \ncond ition had deteriorated further, causing severe pain and other complications. Event 5: Surgery and Post -Surgical Infection (May 2, 2023)",
